# Optimizing Global Supply Chains with Predictive Analytics 🌍

This project explores how a global logistics company optimized its supply chain operations using **predictive analytics** and **generative AI**, including techniques like digital twin simulation, Monte Carlo methods, and reinforcement learning.

---

## 🧩 Business Challenge

A global logistics enterprise with a sprawling network of suppliers, warehouses, and transportation hubs faced mounting challenges in managing its supply chain effectively. The traditional approach—based on historical data and static planning—was increasingly ineffective in dealing with:

- Fluctuating demand across markets  
- Weather-related disruptions  
- Geopolitical events and trade restrictions  
- Inventory imbalance and overstocking  
- Missed delivery timelines and higher freight costs  

These limitations threatened service-level commitments, increased operational costs, and eroded customer satisfaction.

## 🧠 Solution Overview

To address these dynamic challenges, the company implemented a **predictive analytics engine** built on **generative AI and machine learning**. Key components of the solution:

### 🚀 Technology Stack
- **Python & TensorFlow** – model development  
- **Reinforcement Learning (RL)** – for continuous optimization  
- **Monte Carlo Simulations** – to assess uncertainty and risk  
- **Digital Twin Architecture** – virtual replication of the supply chain  
- **ERP Integration** – real-time inputs from inventory and demand systems  
- **Weather & GPS APIs** – to monitor live disruption risks  

### 🧪 Model Capabilities
- Created a **digital twin** of the supply chain to simulate thousands of scenarios  
- Integrated **real-time data feeds** from multiple sources  
- Forecasted **bottlenecks, delays, and excess inventory** before they occurred  
- Recommended **optimal routing, load balancing, and inventory reallocation**

## 💡 Business Impact

| Metric                        | Before (Baseline) | After (With AI)  |
|------------------------------|-------------------|------------------|
| Transportation Costs         | Baseline          | 🔻 10% reduction |
| Inventory Holding Costs      | Baseline          | 🔻 5% reduction  |
| On-Time Delivery Rate        | 90%               | 🔺 93%           |
| Fleet Utilization Efficiency | 72%               | 🔺 84%           |

This resulted in:
- Multi-million dollar savings in logistics spending  
- Increased **resilience** during supply chain shocks  
- Higher **customer satisfaction** and **on-time delivery reliability**  
- A replicable model for **scenario planning** across geographies
